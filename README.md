# DDPM-with-DDIM
DDPM with the function of DDIM

This is my note for DDPMs and DDIM.

This project refering from ddim(https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim) and DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-
(https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-), combines the function to train diffusion 
model and sample in the way of DDPM and DDIM.

I have set two main files for DDPM sampling and DDIM sampling (For training, please use the DDPM main file). For
DDPM it is called main_DDPMs.py, and for DDDIM it is called main.py. And how to use the main files will be suggested 
in the file(The tested function will be represented in # and you can change the string as it is shown.)

Now, it is not tested the function of DDIM based on condition, I will change as soon as possible. As it is my first
work, there will be something bad, and I will modify the relevant comments to make them more standardized.

Thanks again for the projects of ddim(https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim) and DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-
(https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-).

Time permitted, I will upgrade the code.
