# DDPM-with-DDIM
DDPM with the function of DDIM

This project refering from ddim(https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim) and DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-
(https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-), combines the function to train diffusion 
model and sample in the way of DDPM and DDIM.

I have set two main files for DDPM sampling and DDIM sampling (For training, please use the DDPM main file). For
DDPM it is called main_DDPMs.py, and for DDDIM it is called main.py. And how to use the main files will be suggested 
in the file(The tested function will be represented in # and you can change the string as it is shown.)

If there are some mistakes, please check in ddim(https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim) and DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-
(https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-).

Thanks again for the projects of ddim(https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim) and DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-
(https://github.com/zoubohao/DenoisingDiffusionProbabilityModel-ddpm-).
